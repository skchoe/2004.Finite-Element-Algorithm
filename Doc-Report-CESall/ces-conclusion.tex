Throughout this project, we investigate the application of
Spectral Polynomial Element Method to Poisson equations. We also
compared the  of h/p convergence properties of the method to the
classical finite element method. The Galerkin method allows
incorporation of the weak solution into the formulation for the
problem as system of linear equations which can be solved
numerically.

The Spectral element solver for one dimensional Poisson equation
with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, with high-order
solutions exhibited much accurate solutions which were hard to get
acceptable convergence in a given time and resolution of domain in
past.

For the future study, we would like deal with problems regarding:

\begin{itemize}
\item
development multi-dimensional solver.
\item
obtaining solutions to various natural phenomena that obey
governing equations.
\item
utilizing the method in the ill-posed problem. By using certain
technique that we can approximate the solution, we can also apply
this method to the problem and compare with other method in that
situation.
\end{itemize}
