In 2-dimensional case, we looked into the theory of Spectral
Polynomial and Fourier Method and its solvability. We also
investigated the feature of convergence in the viewpoint of h/p
convergence property in comparison to classical finite element
method. By using Galerkin method, we could incorporate the weak
solution and get the problem to be changed to system of linear
equations which we can solve it by computer.

By implementing the Spectral element solver for one dimensional Poisson equation having Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we could experiment all the theory with various specific cases of high-order solutions which were hard to get acceptable convergence in a given time and resolution of domain.
