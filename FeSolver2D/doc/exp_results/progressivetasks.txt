
Chapter 3 Expansion bases

- Will be using Modal basis
- Generalized Modal basis (triangular/tetrahedral domains)
- No baricentric coordinate system(will use collapsed coordinate system)
- Definition of \tilda \psi_pq(pqr)(\eta) with that of supper case a,b,c.
- Quadrilateral <-> collaped : Nonlinear mapping - any problem?
- More general product of L^2 orthogonal expansion 
   \phi_(pq)(\xi_1, \xi_2) = \tilda \psi_p() \psi_pq() , why?
- Comparision between Model/Orthogonal expansion.

- In orthogonal expansion, the mass matrix is mainly diagonal 
- In modified c^0 expansion, see stiffness matrix is mainly diagonal???
