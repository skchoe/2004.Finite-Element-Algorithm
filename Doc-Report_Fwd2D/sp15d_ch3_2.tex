\subsection {High order Polynomial Solution and Its Convergence}

In this section we construct a polynomial $P_n$ of order $n$ defined on $[0,1]$, which satisfies the following.
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{pois_scrv}
    P_n(0) = 0, &P_n(1) = 1 \\
    \frac{d^k}{dx^k}P_n(0) = 0, &\frac{d^k}{dx^k}P_n(1) = 0
\end{eqnarray}
for all $k = 1, \cdots, n-2$. \\
Then for each $n$, we obtain a polynomial $P_n$ by solving a system of linear equations having unique solution which determines the set of coefficients of $P_n$. We will apply the spectral polynomial solver to approximate the second derivative $Q_{n-2}$ of $P_n$.

We will investigate the convergences by the h-type, p-type extension of trial functions below.

\begin{problem}
Consider the following differential equation for $u(x)$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{poi_poly}
-r^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (\sigma \frac{\partial}{\partial r}u) - r \sigma \frac{\partial}{\partial r}u - \sigma \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}u = e^{-(r-1)^2}\{P_n(r) + (2r^2(r-1)-r)P_n'(r) - r^2 P_n''(r)\} \cos \theta,
\end{equation}
for all $r$ in $[0.1, 1.1]$ with $\sigma(r) = e^{-(r-1)^2}$. Then we have the exact solution as follows.
\begin{equation}
u(r, \theta) = P_n(r) \cos \theta
\end{equation}
where $r$ in $[0.1, 1.1]$ and $\theta$ in $[0, 2\pi]$.
\end{problem}

Note that the accuracy of this interpolation satisfying equations (\ref{pois_scrv}) is dependent on the stability of matrix that defines the coefficients of interpolants. We used the Legendre basis function which is known to be more stable than monomials. In spite of this, there exists interpolation error close to $e^{-13}$. This cause the same amount of convergence error in p-type extension mode shown in right of Figure (\ref{ScrvconvDN}) and Table (\ref{hconv2t}).

(Left)Convergence with respect to discrete $L^{\infty}$ norm as a function of size of elements. This test is performed using the h-type extension with fixed polynomial order 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Error on the Log-Log axis is demonstrating the algebraic convergence of the h-type extension.
(Right)Convergence w.r.t. $L^{\infty}$ norm as a function of size of polynomial order in semi-Log plot. It shows the exponential convergence of p-type extension for smooth solution. Two tests are performed for p-type extension with element length $0.2$ and $0.1$.
